# Web Engineering 2021-2022 / microservices

**In this assignment your PR must only modify the `README.md` file**. Please, go to
the [Wiki](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab6-services/wiki) in order to get the instructions for this
assignment.

## Primary goal

The code is based on the post [microservices with Spring](https://spring.io/blog/2015/07/14/microservices-with-spring)
developed by [Paul Chapman](https://github.com/paulc4). The laboratory shows a simple example of setting up
a [microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) system using Spring Boot and Eureka. This project
contains three apps:

* **Service discovery** (`registration` written in Kotlin):
  It launches an open source discovery server called [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) that will use the port
  1111. The dashboard of the registration server is exposed in `http://localhost:1111`.
* **Account service** (`accounts` written in Kotlin):
  It is a standalone process that provides a RESTful server to a repository of accounts that will use the port 2222.
  What it makes special is that it registers itself to Eureka with the name `ACCOUNTS-SERVICE`. After launching this
  service you can see in the dashboard of Eureka that after a few seconds (10-20 secs) the `ACCOUNTS-SERVICE` service
  appears.
* **Web service** (`web` written in Java):
  It is a standalone process that provides an MVC front-end to the application of accounts that will use the port 3333.
  What it makes special is that it registers itself to the Eureka with the name `WEB-SERVICE` and asks the Eureka where
  is the `ACCOUNTS-SERVICE`. Spring configures automatically an instance of `RestTemplate` for using the discovery
  service transparently!!!

This is a *NOT* a speed competition. The objective is to show that the following activities have been accomplished:

* The two services `accounts (2222)` and `web` are running and registered (two terminals, logs screenshots).
* The service registration service has these two services registered (a third terminal, dashboard screenshots)
* A second `accounts` service instance is started and will use the port 4444. This second `accounts (4444)` is also
  registered (a fourth terminal, log screenshots).
* What happens when you kill the service `accounts (2222)` and do requests to `web`?  
  Can the web service provide information about the accounts again? Why?

The above must be documented in a brief report (`report.md`) with screenshots describing what happens.

## Secondary goal (:gift:)

Proposed:

* [Circuit breaker for the requests from web to accounts that avoids a 500 error](https://spring.io/guides/gs/circuit-breaker/)
  .
* [API gateway for web and registration](https://spring.io/guides/gs/routing-and-filtering/).
* [Centralized configuration for all services](https://spring.io/guides/gs/routing-and-filtering/).
* [Dockerize the three services](https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker).
* [Docker compose with scale by command line](https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/dockerize-spring-boot/).

Manifest your intention first by a PR updating this `README.md` with your goal. If you desist of your goal, release it
by a PR so other fellow can try it.
